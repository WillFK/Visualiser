### Run the server

This project is meant to be run on a regular static server. One easy approach is to install http-server and run it in the project folder.

### Load model

- create a folder data inside de project folder. The file name should follow this format: `DS{name}.txt`
- on the browser's console, run the instruction `loadDS({name}, {colorHex})`

like that:
```loadDS("4.2", 0xff0000)```
